CICD - Continous Integration and continous delivery

CI will ensure all the test, code quality & security,
CD - deployments

Jenkins for CI & ArgoCD for CD

Source Code in a github
    * Java Code..whenever devolper do a pull request happens
    * using webhook - git will send the notification to Jenkins

Jenkins will trigger the pipeline(CI) :
    * we use declarative jenkins pipeline
    * since it is a Java application..in stage 1 build the project and unit testing
    * static code analysis 
    * security vulenarability - sonarqube
    * if it is fail..configure alerts email notification
    * create a docker image and push the new image tag to github manifest.

CD :
    * Gitops based tools are best fo cd...
    * github gives versioning..
    * Argo Image updater - it will continous monitor the github update the update the image git repository.
    * ArgoCD - whenever there is a new change , take the yaml file and deploy it in Kubernetes.
    * maintain the state between git and Kubernetes
