You are tasked with setting up a CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins to perform rolling deployments of a microservice to a Kubernetes cluster. The microservice is built as a Docker container. The pipeline should ensure zero downtime during deployments, perform basic health checks after the deployment, and roll back automatically if the deployment fails. How would you design this pipeline?"

    1. get the code from git - webhook
    2. do a static code analysis
    3. check for vulanerability in application dependencies/library,packages
    4. scan the file system using trivy
    5. build the image
    6. scan the image
    7. rolling update
    8. i will configure readiness prob and liveness prob in the kubernetes yaml
    9. deploy to kubernetes..if deplpyment..rollout will rollout the previous version
    10. post action : kubectl rollout undo


You have a Jenkins pipeline set up for a project, and the pipeline works fine when manually triggered. However, when trying to trigger the pipeline automatically via a Git webhook, the build fails with an error message indicating that the Jenkins server is unable to access the repository. What steps would you take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue?

    1. Verify the GitHub token in Jenkins credentials whether it is expired or not.
    2. Ensure the webhook is configured with the correct Jenkins URL and events (such as push or pull request).
