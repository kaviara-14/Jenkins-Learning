CICD - Continous Integration and Continous delivery

    * CI/CD is a process that automates application testing and delivery

        - Unit testing
        - Static-code Analysis
        - vulnerability testing
        - Reporting

    for continous Integration.

    * Jenkins is an orchestrator that automates and integrates various tools in a pipeline like sonarqube,trivy..etc
    * Deploying applications to different environments for testing and production
    * Using GitHub Actions or GitLab pipelines for CI/CD can help save resources and increase efficiency.
    * CI/CD Solutions are scalable and have emerging alternatives like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD.

1. wht is jenkins
    * jenkins is CICD tool that automates application testing and deployments.
    * in jenkins ci part we can do static code analaysis, check for any vulenarability .
    * in jenkins cd part will deploy our application to Kubernetes or any other rool

2. Jenkins Agent
    * Jenkins Agent is also known as jenkins slave
    * Jenkins agent is a separate machine which connects to the jenkins master to build and run the job.
    * jenkins master schedule the task, and jenkins agent will execute them
    * which will allow parallel execution

3. wt is the differencee bt freestyle and pipeline
    pipeline : it's declarative format..we can write code
    freestyle : we can define steps for the build manually in the ui.

4. How do you handle failure scenarios in Jenkins pipelines?
    - try/catch - catch the error.
    - post action - if anything failed..we can confire email
    - retry

5. wht are some essential plugins
    - git 
    - docker
    - maevan

6. declarative pipeline : uses a structured and predefined syntax, make it easier to maintain.
    scripted pipeline : groovy syntax complex to understand..

7 . wht is the differencee between continous Integration, continous deployments, continous delivery

    Continous Integration : In CI,  Developers push code changes..using webhooks we will trigger
    we will automate the ci part where we will do unit testing, static code analysis, check for the vulenarability, if we r using any image we will scan 
    the Image.
    In CI, will make sure we have high code quality with all the security features

    Continous delivery : CD extends CI by automating the release process to ensure the application can be deployed to production at any time.
    Automated builds are deployed to staging or test environments for further validation.
    Manual or semi-automated approval processes may exist before deploying to production.

    continous deployments :
    Continuous Deployment takes Continuous Delivery a step further by automating the deployment of every change that passes the automated tests directly into production without manual approval
    Code changes that pass all tests and validations are automatically pushed to production.
    Monitoring systems ensure deployed changes are functioning correctly.

8. Jenkins using domain specific language called groovy.

9. RBAC ensures users have the appropriate access permissions in Jenkins, enhancing security and access control.
 create a role attach a role to user or grop
RBAC, Jenkins to manage user permissions
