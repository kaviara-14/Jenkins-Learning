CICD - Continous Integration and Continous delivery

    * CI/CD is a process that automates application testing and delivery

        - Unit testing
        - Static-code Analysis
        - vulnerability testing
        - Reporting

    for continous Integration.

    * Jenkins is an orchestrator that automates and integrates various tools in a pipeline like sonarqube,trivy..etc
    * Deploying applications to different environments for testing and production
    * Using GitHub Actions or GitLab pipelines for CI/CD can help save resources and increase efficiency.
    * CI/CD Solutions are scalable and have emerging alternatives like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD.

1. wht is jenkins
    * jenkins is CICD tool that automates application testing and deployments.
    * in jenkins ci part we can do static code analaysis, check for any vulenarability .
    * in jenkins cd part will deploy our application to Kubernetes or any other rool

2. Jenkins Agent
    * Jenkins Agent is also known as jenkins slave
    * Jenkins agent is a separate machine which connects to the jenkins master to build and run the job.
    * jenkins master schedule the task, and jenkins agent will execute them
    * which will allow parallel execution

3. wt is the differencee bt freestyle and pipeline
    pipeline : it's declarative format..we can write code
    freestyle : we can define steps for the build manually in the ui.

4. How do you handle failure scenarios in Jenkins pipelines?
    - try/catch - catch the error.
    - post action - if anything failed..we can confire email
    - retry

5. wht are some essential plugins
    - git 
    - docker
    - maevan

6. declarative pipeline : uses a structured and predefined syntax, make it easier to maintain.
    scripted pipeline : groovy syntax complex to understand..
