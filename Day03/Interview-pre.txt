1. can u explain the cicd process in your current project ? or can u talk about any cicd process
that u have implemented ?

    we r using Jenkins to achieve the CICD
        * Sonarqube,
        * Trivy
        * App Scan
        * ArgoCd
        * Docker 
        * Kubernetes

    - code commit 
    - Jenkins will trigger 
    - pull the Code 
    - Build the Code 
    - static code analaysis 
    - App scan 
    - build the Docker image and using argocd image updater directly update the image in manifest
    - Argocd will look for manifest new tag
    - we can deploy Kubernetes

2. wht are the different ways to trigger Jenkins pipeline ?

    poll scm : Jenkins periodically checks the source code repository (e.g., Git) for changes.
    for every 5 mins

    build trigger : Manual trigger using build now

    webhooks : Trigger pipelines automatically when a change occurs in a repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    Set up a webhook in the repository to notify Jenkins of changes.


3. How to take backup Jenkins ?
    Jobs, Plugins, settings, build history
    * we can use some plugins like thin thinback or backup plugin.
    * we can write a script and schedule corn job to take backup

3. how do u store/secure/handle secrets in jenkins ?
    
    * credentials plugin that can be used to store the value
    * Hashicorp vault - integrate jenkins with Hashicorp vault, invoke the secret from vault

4. wht is the latest version of jenkins ?

    * 2.491

5. shared modules in jenkins

    * re-use the same pipeline shared across multiple teams.

7. auto scaling feaure for jenkins

8. how to add new worker node in jenkins
    mananges jenkins -> manage node - new node

9. wht agents u r using
- docker agent
- Kubernetes agents
- aws

10 wht is sonarqube ?
    sonarqube will do a static code analysis, it will ensure high quality code
    it identifies bugs in code and check for vulenarability ,unwanted variables declaration and  syntax. 

    And it will give as a report.

11.sonarqube quality gate
    it is a predefined a condition that code can met to pass the acceptable quality

12. OWASP Depedency is a SCA Tool(software composition analaysis)
    it will check for the vulenarability in the application dependencies or libraries.
    It will check against public vulenarability database

13. trivy will scan the Container images and file system for any vulenarability
Securing Container Image using trivy in CICD Pipeline

14. "Your Jenkins pipeline fails during the build stage due to a missing dependency in the application.
 How would you debug and resolve this issue?"

I will check console output first understand the Solutions
In requirement.txt i will check for the missing dependencies
i will configure post actions

15. "You deployed a new version of your application to Kubernetes using a Jenkins pipeline, but the application started failing. How would you roll back the deployment?"

I will use kubernetess describe pods
if i am using helm i will use heml rollback back
if i am using argocd,  i will revert the commit and sync it
